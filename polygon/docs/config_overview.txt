Loads environment variables from your root .env file (one level up from the polygon folder)
Provides centralized configuration for:

API settings (endpoints, keys, timeouts)
Storage paths and caching settings
Rate limiting based on Polygon subscription tiers
Market hours and timezone configuration
Logging setup with file rotation


Key features:

Singleton pattern with get_config() for easy access throughout the module
Configuration override capability for testing
Automatic directory creation for data storage
Comprehensive logging setup
Export configuration to JSON for debugging


Market timezone is now pytz.UTC to match Polygon's API
Market hours are converted to UTC times:

Pre-market: 9:00 AM UTC (4:00 AM ET)
Regular start: 2:30 PM UTC (9:30 AM ET)
Regular end: 9:00 PM UTC (4:00 PM ET)
Post-market end: 1:00 AM UTC (8:00 PM ET)


Added DST handling with separate summer hours (when US markets are UTC-4 instead of UTC-5)
Added timestamp configuration:

use_utc_timestamps = True
timestamp_unit = 'ms' (Polygon uses milliseconds)


Module constant POLYGON_TIMEZONE = pytz.UTC at the top
