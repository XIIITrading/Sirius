## System Overview

This system bridges manual technical analysis with automated ranking and execution. It takes manually identified support/resistance levels from three distinct categories, applies a confluence-based ranking algorithm, and generates TradingView visualization code for intraday trading.

## Architecture Design

### Core Components

1. **Manual Identification Layer**
    - Uses TradingView for visual pattern recognition
    - Focuses on three level types: HVN (High Volume Nodes), Daily Market Structure, and H1 Order Blocks
    - Each type represents different market mechanics and timeframes
2. **Data Pipeline**
    - Notion serves as the manual input interface
    - Supabase acts as the central database
    - Python processes and ranks the levels
    - TradingView displays the final output
3. **Ranking Engine**
    - Confluence-based scoring system
    - Considers type importance, proximity, and strength
    - Outputs prioritized zones with ATR-based boundaries
4. **Visualization Layer**
    - Generates Pine Script code dynamically
    - Color-codes by level type
    - Displays ranking and confluence information

## Detailed Implementation Steps

### Phase 1: Database Infrastructure

### Supabase Schema Design

Create three primary tables that form the backbone of the system:

**premarket_levels table**

- Stores manually identified levels from technical analysis
- Each record represents one price level with its category and position
- Includes metadata like strength score and identification notes
- Uses composite unique constraint to prevent duplicate entries

**ranked_levels table**

- Contains processed results from the ranking engine
- Links back to source levels while adding computed metrics
- Stores zone boundaries calculated using ATR
- Includes TradingView variable names for code generation

**level_performance table**

- Tracks how each level performed during the trading session
- Records price interactions (touches, breaks, reversals)
- Enables feedback loop for improving ranking algorithm
- Stores session OHLC data for context

### Notion Database Structure

Create a Notion database with the following properties:

- Date (Date property)
- Ticker (Select property with common symbols)
- Level Type (Select: HVN, Daily MS, H1 OB)
- Position (Select: Above 1, Above 2, Below 1, Below 2)
- Price (Number property with 2 decimal places)
- Strength Score (Number 1-100)
- Notes (Text property for observations)
- Active (Checkbox for filtering)

Set up Notion-Supabase integration using native integrations or Zapier/Make.com for automatic syncing.

### Phase 2: Manual Level Identification Process

### HVN (High Volume Node) Identification

**Timeframe**: Use 5-minute or 15-minute charts with volume profile indicator
**Lookback Period**: Analyze 14-30 days of data
**Identification Criteria**:

- Locate price levels with highest volume concentration
- Look for clear volume shelves or peaks
- Prioritize levels that acted as support/resistance previously
- Select 2 levels above and 2 below current price

**Strength Scoring Guidelines** (1-100):

- 80-100: Major volume peak with multiple touches
- 60-79: Clear volume shelf with some price reactions
- 40-59: Moderate volume increase
- Below 40: Minor volume concentration

### Daily Market Structure Identification

**Timeframe**: Daily chart
**Lookback Period**: 3-6 months
**Identification Criteria**:

- Find significant swing highs and lows
- Look for levels that caused market structure shifts (BOS/CHoCH)
- Identify levels where trend changed direction
- Focus on levels with clean price action

**Strength Scoring Guidelines**:

- 80-100: Major pivot that changed primary trend
- 60-79: Significant swing point with multiple respects
- 40-59: Clear swing high/low
- Below 40: Minor pivot point

### H1 Order Block Identification

**Timeframe**: 1-hour chart
**Lookback Period**: 5-10 days
**Identification Criteria**:

- Find last bullish/bearish candle before significant moves
- Look for imbalances or inefficiencies
- Identify institutional candle patterns
- Focus on blocks with clean departures

**Strength Scoring Guidelines**:

- 80-100: Large candle with immediate strong move
- 60-79: Clear order block with good follow-through
- 40-59: Moderate order block
- Below 40: Weak or questionable block

### Phase 3: Ranking Algorithm Design

### Confluence Scoring System

The ranking engine evaluates each level based on four primary factors:

**1. Type Weight (40% of score)**

- HVN levels receive highest weight (100%)
- Daily Market Structure receives high weight (80%)
- H1 Order Blocks receive moderate weight (60%)
- Rationale: Volume-based levels typically more reliable

**2. Manual Strength Score (20% of score)**

- Direct input from manual analysis
- Reflects analyst's confidence in the level
- Normalized to 0-20 point scale

**3. Confluence Factor (25% of score)**

- Checks for other levels within 1.5x ATR
- Awards points for nearby levels of different types
- Maximum 25 points for strong confluence
- Different types in confluence score higher than same type

**4. Distance Score (15% of score)**

- Closer levels to current price score higher
- Uses percentage distance from current price
- Maximum 15 points for very close levels
- Helps prioritize actionable levels

### Zone Calculation

Each level becomes a zone using ATR-based boundaries:

- Zone Width = ATR × Multiplier (default 1.0)
- Zone High = Level Price + Zone Width
- Zone Low = Level Price - Zone Width
- Allows for price noise and improves hit rate

### Final Ranking Process

1. Calculate individual scores for each level
2. Apply position multipliers (closer positions weighted higher)
3. Sort by total confluence score
4. Assign ranks 1-12 (for 3 types × 4 positions)
5. Generate TradingView variable names

### Phase 4: TradingView Code Generation

### Script Structure

The generated Pine Script includes:

**Header Section**

- Script version and indicator declaration
- Title with ticker and date
- Input parameters for customization

**Configuration Section**

- ATR multiplier input for zone width adjustment
- Toggle switches for zones and labels
- Color definitions for each level type

**Level Definitions**

- Variable declarations for each ranked level
- Named using systematic convention (hvn_a1, ds_b2, etc.)

**Drawing Logic**

- Horizontal lines at each level price
- Shaded zones using ATR-based boundaries
- Labels showing type, rank, and score
- Color-coded by level type

**Information Table**

- Summary table in top-right corner
- Lists all active levels with prices
- Color-coded for quick reference

### Variable Naming Convention

Systematic naming for easy identification:

- HVN levels: hvn_a1, hvn_a2, hvn_b1, hvn_b2
- Daily MS: ds_a1, ds_a2, ds_b1, ds_b2
- H1 OB: ob_a1, ob_a2, ob_b1, ob_b2

Where:

- a = above current price
- b = below current price
- 1 = closer to price
- 2 = farther from price
